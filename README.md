# Visual ReportX .NET

VRX is a report component for .net plataform.

It is based on Visual ReportX component for old Visual Basic 6 applications that you can find in http://www.joinbit.com/reportx (portuguese only)

This is a component write in VB.NET (to help on migration of VB applications) to accelerate the report design process allowing the developer to code it through a set of classes that represents report properties, report sections and report controls.

Developers can print or preview it using a .net framework print/preview classes like PrintDialog and PrintPreviewDialog because its main component extends a PrintDocument.

In addition the core classes there is a Windows Form project with controls that represents the sections and fields in an empty form to easy configure sections and fields and encapsulate report design into application executable. There is a sample application in the solution to demonstrate it.

If you are a Visual Basic developer, you can download the VB6 old version to try understand the final goal of this project. 

Documentation of how to use each class will be write later but it is easy to understand through the sample project.

Enjoy it.
